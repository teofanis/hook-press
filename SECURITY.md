# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest **minor** release line with security fixes.

| Version | Supported          |
|--------:|:-------------------|
| 1.x     | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

> If in doubt, open a private report — we’ll clarify support on a case-by-case basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not** open public issues for security problems.

Please report vulnerabilities via **GitHub Security Advisories** or email:

- GitHub: open a private advisory from the repository’s **“Security” → “Advisories”** page.
- Email: **hook-press@teofanis-cloud.com** (include “HookPress Security” in the subject)

Include as much detail as possible:
- Affected versions and environment
- A minimal reproduction or proof-of-concept
- Impact assessment (confidentiality / integrity / availability)
- Any suggested mitigations

We will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours** and keep you informed of the fix timeline. Once a fix is available, we will publish a new release and coordinate disclosure.

## Public Disclosure

Please give us reasonable time to investigate and release a patch before any public disclosure. We prefer coordinated disclosure with credit in the release notes, unless you request anonymity.

Thank you for helping keep HookPress and its users secure. 🙏
